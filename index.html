            Apriori is a coding school based out of 40 cities in 25 countries.
            We bring coding skills to creative people who aim to create their
            own startup, or add a technical know-how to their skillset.

          <p>
            Our Web Development bootcamp teaches you all the web stack, from the
            database to the browser. You will learn the core concepts of
            object-oriented programming, and structure your software following
            design patterns like MVC. In addition to mastering back-end
            programming languages (Ruby, SQL), you will develop your front-end
            skills using recent techniques like flexbox, CSS grid and learn ES6,
            the latest version of JavaScript.

            We strongly believe that there is a good way of building web
            products. During our bootcamp, we teach you how successful startups
            work: design your project's wireframe & mockup, test your UX with a
            prototype, split your user stories across your team and collaborate
            with branch and pull requests with git and Github.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Data Science bootcamp takes you all the way from Pandas to Deep
            Learning. You finish the course knowing how to explore, clean and
            transform data into actionable insights and how to implement Machine
            Learning models from start to finish in a production environment,
            working in teams with the best-in-class tool belt.
          </p>
          <p>
            We originally created our coding bootcamps with a full-time format:
            9 intensive weeks to learn Web Development or Data Science. In order
            to make our coding bootcamps accessible to even more people, we
            decided to adapt our courses to a part-time format: 24 weeks, 2
            evenings per week and Saturdays. This format enables you to learn
            coding while keeping your current job.

          <h3>Committed to excellence</h3>
          <p>
            Since 2013, we have constantly been improving our curriculum and
            tools to match our students’ needs, getting rid of every friction in
            the process of learning to code. Our in-house trained teachers adapt
            to every student’s pace and level, making sure that nobody’s left
            behind. As a result, Apriori has constantly had the highest number
            of excellent student reviews on ranking websites.
          </p>
          <h3>An international community</h3>
          <p>
            After the bootcamp, a new life starts. Our alumni keep a lifetime
            access to our online learning platform, with up-to-date videos and
            tutorials about the latest tools and best practices of software
            development. But most importantly, they belong to a community and
            network of people who help each other, using our internal chat and
            alumni database to share tips and opportunities.
          </p>
          <h3>A hands-on bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            Apriori is a hands-on bootcamp. During the last 2 weeks of our Web
            Development course, our students learn how to build robust and
            beautiful web applications by themselves, likewise students work on
            real data science projects at the end of our Data Science course.
            All our students learn to collaborate within a team of developers or
            data scientists and adopt the technical workflow followed by most
            successful tech companies.
